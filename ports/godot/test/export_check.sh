# Does an EXPORTED Godot build still find its bundle?
#
# This is the question nothing else here asks, and the reason #45 reached users: every Godot check in
# this repo runs inside the editor, where a .storyletsc is on disk whatever the addon does to it. An
# exported build is a different filesystem, and 0.4.3 changed what lands in it.
#
#   ports/godot/test/export_check.sh          # needs Godot + export templates installed
#
# Skips (exit 0) when Godot or its export templates are missing, so it can sit in a script that runs
# anywhere; it is a MAINTAINER gate, not a CI one, until a runner has an engine on it.
#
# Two assertions, and the first is the one that would have caught #45 on any machine:
#
#   1. The addon must NOT turn a bundle into an imported resource. `.storyletsc` is a plain file that
#      games read with FileAccess; an importer changes how it ships and what `res://x.storyletsc`
#      resolves to. If a .storyletsc.import appears, or ResourceLoader claims the path, that is the fault.
#   2. With the documented export setting (`*.storyletsc` in "filters to export non-resource files"), an
#      exported pack must contain the bundle and the game must play its first beat from it.
#
# The pack is run from a directory with NO project.godot above it. Getting that wrong makes the test
# read the source tree instead of the pack, which is how three of my earlier results said "fine" about
# builds that were never examined.
